# 🤖 Welcome to the Humanoid Robotics Book

Let's begin the fascinating journey into the world of **Humanoid Robotics**. This book is designed to provide a comprehensive, structured understanding, starting from foundational principles to advanced AI integration.

---

## Getting Started: The Vision

This book serves as a technical resource for students, developers, and enthusiasts interested in the complex interplay of **mechanical engineering, software development, and artificial intelligence** that defines modern humanoid robots.

Our goal is not just to explain concepts, but to provide a practical roadmap.

### What You Will Learn

* **Foundations of Kinematics:** Understanding how humanoid robots move and balance.
* **Full-Stack Development for Robotics:** Applying Next.js, Python, and Agentic AI to control and optimize robot behavior.
* **Actuator and Sensor Integration:** The hardware essentials for building functional robots.
* **Modern AI Integration (Agentic AI):** Implementing smart, autonomous decision-making systems.

## 📖 Book Structure and Navigation

This book is organized logically into chapters, guiding you systematically through the field of robotics:

1.  **Introduction & Fundamentals:** (Where you are now) Setting the stage with core definitions and historical context.
2.  **Software Stack Deep Dive:** Exploring the full-stack technologies (Python, Next.js, TypeScript) used for control.
3.  **Mechanical Design & Control:** Understanding movement, balance, and hardware interaction.
4.  **Advanced AI & Autonomy:** Focusing on Agentic AI and complex decision-making algorithms.

Start by navigating through the chapters listed in the sidebar. We encourage a hands-on approach and hope this serves as your definitive guide to building and programming humanoid systems!
